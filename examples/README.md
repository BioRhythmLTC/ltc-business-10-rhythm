# Examples

Place customer-provided submission CSVs here for testing, e.g.,  `submission.csv`.
If you download `submission2.csv` from GitHub Releases, save it as `examples/submission2.csv`.

CSV format (semicolon-separated):

- Column: `search_query`
- (For evaluation) columns: `id;search_query;annotation`

These files are allowed by .gitignore only within this `examples/` directory.
